# CIS700
This repository serves as a code hosting repository for CIS700 Deep learning and theorem proving final project. The included google Colab notebook contains the code. It is necessary to upload the holstep data to a 'data/' directory in colab to run the code. To do this, take the first 30 files from the holstep training set and upload them to a directory called data in the colab notebook. In addition to this, upload a verificaiton file for verification. Ensure that the paths are correctly set in the colab code.

## Proposal
- Name: Youdan Zhang, Yehya Farhat, Peter Valentine

- SUEmail:yzhan143@syr.edu, ymfarhat@syr.edu, pjvalent@syr.edu

- Dataset: Holstep

- Model: We will be using a transformer model trainnig on the Holstep dataset to train the transformer to predict if steps in theorem proving are useful or not. 

- In attention is all you need, the authors propose the multi head attention transformer model to learn translation tasks on input sequences. For our purposes we will be utilizing the transformer model to predict the usefulness of steps in automated theorem proving problems in the Holstep data set.
