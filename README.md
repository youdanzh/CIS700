## Proposal
- Name: Youdan Zhang, Yehya Farhat, Peter Valentine

- SUEmail:yzhan143@syr.edu, ymfarhat@syr.edu, pjvalent@syr.edu

- Dataset: Holstep Mizar

- Model: We will be using the GCN model presented in this paper as our baseline https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf 

- in the above paper the main technique used by the authors to improve prediciton accuracy is by passing in a symmetric adjacency matrix A (binary or weighted) to the model before training. in our project we will try to pass in other similarity metrics before training and measure it agaisnt the baseline metric (A hat)
