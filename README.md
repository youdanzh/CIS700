# CIS700
This repository serves as a code hosting repository for CIS700 Deep learning and theorem proving final project. The included google Colab notebook contains the code. It is necessary to upload the holstep data to a 'smaller_train/' directory in colab to run the code. for best code reproducibility upload only the first 5-10 files from the holstep train folder and for validation and testing upload any file from the holstep test folder to the root colab directory, but it is best if the 0005 file is used as it is the one used in our project because its a mid sized file compared to the rest.

## Proposal
- Name: Youdan Zhang, Yehya Farhat, Peter Valentine

- SUEmail:yzhan143@syr.edu, ymfarhat@syr.edu, pjvalent@syr.edu

- Dataset: Holstep

- Model: We will be using a transformer model trainnig on the Holstep dataset to train the transformer to predict if steps in theorem proving are useful or not. 

- In attention is all you need, the authors propose the multi head attention transformer model to learn translation tasks on input sequences. For our purposes we will be utilizing the transformer model to predict the usefulness of steps in automated theorem proving problems in the Holstep data set.
